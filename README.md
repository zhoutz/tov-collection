# Collection of some TOV solving algorithms

# Usage
Run the following command to execute the benchmark script:
```console
python3 p/bench.py inte_r
```

Run the following command to plot the error/performance analysis figure:
```console
python3 p/p_err_time.py inte_r
```

Substitute `inte_r` with other algorithm name (`inte_p`) to run the benchmark or plot for that specific algorithm.

# Documentation
See the [doc](https://typst.app/project/rjYAvMZ6LKh7AiPwIYLLPv)
for derivations and explanations of each algorithm.
